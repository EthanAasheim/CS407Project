Hello world

I've found an open-source Python library for controlling my specific brand of light bulbs here:
https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan

I've cloned the repo and tested it (I'm out of town so I don't have my lightbulbs to test, but the code runs).

Sorry for the lack of progress - midterms and other classes have taken up more time than I expected.
I will work on this Wednesday the 9th when I am back in Eugene and don't have pressing projects in other courses.
