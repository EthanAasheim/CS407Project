<h2>My name is Ethan Aasheim and I am currently a senior at UO<h2>

I am proficient in Python, HTML, JS, and CSS and familiar with C, C++, and Git.

I prefer front-end web developement and software engineering over the more abstract areas of computer science. I work best when I can produce tangile results,

My major is in Computer Science with an emphasis on software engineering.

Over the past summer I did a paid internship at 2 Minute Warning, which is a Eugene based data analyitics company. I was hired as a front-end web developer and tasked with building a JS web app for clients to upload data and receive analysis.
I also worked with quality control to show error statistics in the web app. I designed and programmed most UI for the company website, and added a dynamic media player to display client data Unfortunatly, in order to see most of this project you would need to become a client of the company.
